    For each point:
    - Start with a brief empathetic acknowledgment
    - Follow with a clear, practical action they can take right now
    - Keep suggestions realistic and immediately doable
    - Include a mix of physical, mental, and social activities
    - Format each point with a bullet point (â€¢)
    
    Keep the tone warm and supportive, but focus on concrete actions rather than just emotional comfort.
